            <p class="whiteText">To be, or not to be--that is the question:
                    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
                    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune
                    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
                    And by opposing end them. To die, to sleep--
                    No more--and by a sleep to say we end
                    The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks
                    That flesh is heir to. 'Tis a consummation
                    Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep--
                    To sleep--perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub,
                    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
                    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
                    Must give us pause. There's the respect
                    That makes calamity of so long life.
                    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
                    Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely
                    The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
                    The insolence of office, and the spurns
                    That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
                    When he himself might his quietus make
                    With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
                    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
                    But that the dread of something after death,
                    The undiscovered country, from whose bourn
                    No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
                    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
                    Than fly to others that we know not of?
                    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
                    And thus the native hue of resolution
                    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
                    And enterprise of great pitch and moment
                    With this regard their currents turn awry
                    And lose the name of action. -- Soft you now,
                    The fair Ophelia! -- Nymph, in thy orisons
                    Be all my sins remembered.
